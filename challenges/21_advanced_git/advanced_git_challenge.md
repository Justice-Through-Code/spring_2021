# Git Collab (Pairs) Challenge!

In this challenge, you will:

* Modify your local Git settings to use your preferred text editor
* Add collaborators to a Git repository
* Practice dealing with merge conflicts

## Step 0: Checking your local Git settings
When you first open Git, it is going to make some assumptions about your default preferences. These settings can be viewed by typing `git config --list` from your terminal session.

You can see all possible options for things you could set by typing `git config`.

In the earlier lesson on Git, you used `git config` to modify your username, email address, and preferred text editor. If you have not yet changed the default text editor to your preference, complete the following steps. Otherwise, if you have already done this step, move on to step 1.

Because today you will be working a lot with commit messages, another helpful configuration setting might be to set your default text editor. If you don't do this, Git will usually default to using a command line text editor like [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi), or [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/).

While [some people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war#:~:text=vi%20is%20a%20smaller%20and,vim%20is%20almost%20as%20fast.&text=Emacs%20uses%20metakey%20chords.) love these text editors, they can be a bit cumbersome to learn especially when you are new to using terminal.

Luckily, we can configure our Git session to use whatever text editor we prefer. Here is how to do this for VS Code:
-`git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`

A full list for other common text editors can be found [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html).

## Step 1: Creating a Git repo for this challenge
In order to practice merge conflicts today, but not mess up any of your existing Git repositories, we're going to create a fresh repo to work with today.

Since we're working on collaborative coding, you'll want to break into small groups of 2-3 people. 

### One person creates the repository
Only one person needs to make the repository (the others will get access to it by `cloning` in a little while).

1. Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/). You may need to login to your account.

2. On the left-hand side of the navigation bar, there should be an option to create a new repository.

3. This should take you to a page where you can give this new repository. Give your repo a name, decide if it's going to be public or private, and initialize it with a README.

4. For your first commit, make some changes to the README. This could be a description of the project (always a good idea to have this in your README - see [here](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) for examples of quality READMEs), or just some junk text to get us going.

Note: this process can also be [done from the command line](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/shell/how+to+initialize+a+git+repository+command+line).


## Step 2: Adding collaborators
In order to work with someone else on a GitHub repository, you must grant them write access to the code.

This can be done on GitHub as long as you know the other person's username.

1. Go to your project's settings

2. Select `manage access`

3. You may need to confirm your login to GitHub - this is the password you initially used to login.

4. Select `invite a collaborator`

5. Find the person you want to collaborate with via their username, and actually send the invite!

Great! Now your collaborator should have full push/pull access to your repository.

In order for your collaborator to start working in your repository, they will need to accept the collaborator invitation. Usually, github will send them an email with a link to follow. If not, they should be able to see the invitation in their [notifications](https://github.com/notifications).



## Step 3: Collaborators clone the github repository

Now that the collaborators all have access to the repository, they can 'clone' it to their own computers. Remember, to **make sure NOT to clone the repository inside another git respository**. Collaborators can run `git status` first before cloning to make sure that they aren't already in a git repository (i.e. it should say 'fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories)'). 


## Step 4: Each collaborator add 1 new file to the repo.

Remember, the **first** thing you should do when collaborating is to check that you are not missing out on any updates from the remote by running `git fetch` or `git pull` first. This will make sure that you don't get off track with the remote repo.

1. Then, make a new file named `merge_prac.md` and add a sentence to it.
2. Both partners should add and commit this file. One partner should push this file.


## Step 5: Creating a merge conflict
1. The partner that did not push their `merge_prac.md` file should try to push their commit. What happens?

2. Let's retrieve your partner's changes by now running `git pull`.

## Step 6: Resolving merge conflicts
1. In this case, you both made changes to the same file. Now we need to resolve where your workflows have diverged before we can continue.

If you've been reading the Git messages closely, you may have noticed that it is offering you a way forward:

2. If you look at the file in your text editor, you'll notice that the lines where there is a discrepancy are marked with `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>`. This may look different depending on your text editor, but in Atom mine looked something like this:
<img src="images/merge-conflict-in-atom.png" width="500">

In order to move forward, you will need to edit the file so that only the text you want in the final version remains. This will also mean removing the tags surrounding the text that marks the zone of conflict.

After making these changes, your file might look something like this:
<img src="images/merge-conflict-in-atom-post-resolve.png" width="500">

3. Once you have modified the code in your text editor, you will be able to finish making this commit. 

You can see another example of creating a merge conflict [here.](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/09-conflict/index.html)

## Advanced options
### Git stash
Sometimes you have local changes that you are not yet ready to formalize into a commit, but you still need to pull changes from the remote location. In this case, it can be helpful to `stash` your changes.

This essentially temporarily hides away your local changes so that they remain unaffected when you pull changes from the remote.

To do this, you will first need to `git stash` your changes, `git pull`, and then to recover your local edits `git pop stash`.

Be careful while using the stash though — never leave changes unpopped for too long!

### Pulling with rebase
If you want Git to try to avoid merge conflicts when you are pulling in remote changes, you can add the option `--rebase`.

This option essentially uses the syntax we would use when working with multiple branches. In brief, pulling is like merging changes into your existing workflow whereas rebasing crushes your work with something new.
